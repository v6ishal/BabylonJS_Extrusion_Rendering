# BabylonJS_Extrusion_Rendering

I have made the code on VSCode, to run it, I have used Live Server Extension.

The Assignment have 4 mode-
1.  Draw
2.  Extrude
3.  Move
4.  Vertex edit

Draw
In this mode, you can add number of points on the ground, and then by right click, polygon is closed.

Extrude
Polygon made above steps is then extruded by some units. Input can be given for the extrude lenght.

Move
In this, the extruded polygon can be moved on the ground by dragging.

Vertex Edit
In this, vertex on the ground can be edited, and the polygon will remain extruded, while vertices are changed.
This can be done after/before moving the object.
